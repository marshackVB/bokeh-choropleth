# Creating an interactive choropleth map using Bokeh  

[View the notebook here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/marshackVB/projects/raw/4f2268a09c3243ac55770deeb686e99e7441dab4/choropleth/Bokeh_choropleth.ipynb)  

In this project I am creating a county-level choropleth map that utilizes Bokeh's interactive hover tool. State and county-level shape files are processes and joined to a Pandas Dataframe of county-level population. The processed shape file data can then be used to make any county-level map.
